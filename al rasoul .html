          His name</h1>

          Muhammad bin Abdullah bin Abd al-Muttalib bin Hashim bin Abd Manaf bin Qusai bin Kilab bin Murra bin Ka’b bin Luay bin Ghalib bin Fahr bin Malik bin An-Nadr bin Kinana bin Khuzaymah bin Mudarka bin Elias bin Mudar bin Nizar bin Maad Bin Adnan, and the name of his tribe is stamped Quraysh.

          The Prophet - upon him be peace and blessings - was born on Monday, the twelfth of the month of Rabi` al-Awwal, due to what the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said when he was asked about fasting on Monday: (That is the day on which I was born, and the day on which I was sent, or on which revelation was sent down to me), and it came from Qais bin Makhramah - may God be pleased with him - that he said: (The Prophet and I were born in the year of the elephant), and his birth was at the beginning of the day at the onset of dawn,[As for the date of the birth of the Prophet in Gregorian; It was on the twenty-second of April, in the year five hundred and seventy-one AD

        <h1>his qualities</h1>
        <p>
          The face of the Prophet, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, was medium between roundness and fluidity, and he was a beautiful face for the beholders, and if he smiled, his face was like a part of the moon, and he had two arched eyebrows between them, a light connection that was not seen most of the time, and he had wide black eyes, imbued with red in their whites, and this is from The signs of prophecy that the monk spoke about before his mission, and he had a long nose with a height in the middle, and he, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, had white cheeks, a wide mouth, and his teeth were parted between his folds, and he had a good beard with thick roots, and he, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, had a prominent neck .
          His head, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, had a huge head, and he had black hair that was combed between smooth and rough, and he used to leave it long in most cases to reach his earlobes, and there was only some gray hair in his head and beard, and they said when he died, may God bless him and grant him peace, he had seventeen Shaybah in the most likely novels.
          His forearms, may God bless him and grant him peace, were long and hairy, and his shoulders were wide and his armpits were white. As for his palms, they were wide and huge, soft and smooth as if they were a silk cloth, and his fingers were long and not knotted.
          His legs The Messenger of God, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, had white legs, and large members such as the knee and the joint, and that is an indication of his strength, as he, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, was similar in his feet to Abraham, peace be upon him, and this was noticed by looking at Abraham’s standing and footprints.

        <h1>His miracles</h1>
        <p>
          The Holy Qur’an In the Holy Qur’an there are verses that indicate the greatness of its bounty, and the lessons, lessons and miracles it contains are so many that the mind stands in amazement before them. Glory be to Him -: (And it is a revelation of the Lord of the Worlds).

          Isra and Mi'raj The miracle of the Isra' and Mi'raj is the second largest miracle with which God Almighty supported His Prophet Muhammad - may God bless him and grant him peace - after the Holy Qur'an. The Grand Mosque in Mecca to Al-Aqsa Mosque
          
          The splitting of the moon God Almighty supported His Messenger with the miracle of the splitting of the moon. And they followed their desires, and every matter is settled * And there has come to them news that is reprehensible * Great wisdom, but it does not sing vow)
