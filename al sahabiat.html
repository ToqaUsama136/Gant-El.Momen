And she was called Umm Abdullah, and she was called the same as the two migrations, that is, the migration of Abyssinia and the migration of Medina. God’s power wanted Ruqyah to provide, after her patience, a righteous and generous husband from the eight who preceded to Islam, and one of the ten who were given the glad tidings of Paradise.

                She is Umm Kulthum, the daughter of the Messenger of God, and her mother is Khadija bint Khuwaylid. Otaiba bin Abi Lahab bin Abd al-Muttalib married her before the prophethood, so when the Messenger of God was sent, and God revealed: {The hand of Abi Lahab has perished} his father, Abu Lahab, said to him: My head from your head is forbidden if you do not divorce his daughter, so he separated from her and did not enter into marriage with her, so she remained in Mecca with the Messenger God . Umm Kulthum is older than Ruqayyah and Fatimah. Others disagreed with him, and it is correct that she is younger than Ruqaya.

And it was part of his love for her, may God bless him and grant him peace, that he did not leave Medina as a traveler until he saw Fatima, and his last visit to Medina was to see her honorable face. And when he returns to Medina, the first time he visits the mosque, he prays two rak'ahs there, then he goes to it with longing and his heart is filled with longing for it. The love between Fatima and the Prophet, may God bless him
